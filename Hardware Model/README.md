## FPGA Implementation
For performance analyses we designed the entire model onto field-programmable gate array to study the reports and justify the proposed design scheme. **Figure. 1** showcases the testbench of the BiNN model and Table I presents the hardware utilization reports. The input layer takes in 16-bit integer data where the most- significant bit (MSB) is the sign bit. 

## Resource Utilization
| Slice LUTs | Bonded IOB| BUFGCTRL | Slice registers | MUX | LUT as Logic | Slice |
| ---------- | ----------| -------- | --------------- | ----| ------------ | ----- |
| 2061       | 34        | 1        | 17              | 2   | 2061         | 603   |

## TestBench

**Figure. 1**: Testbench Generated by Vivado HLx software. Model was Implemented on a General Purpose Nexys Artix-7 FPGA Hardware. "Class" identifies the successful classification binary output "1" or "0" based on the input value of x1: R-R interval of single Lead ECG signal and x2: SpO2 data from Pulse oximeter  

**The testbench table is given below**
| ECG Signal (R-R Interval) | Pulse Oximeter SPO2| Classification |
| ------------------------- | -------------------| -------------- |
| 100                       | 93                 |       1        |
| 97                        | 99                 |       0        |
| 101                       | 83                 |       1        |

Training, validation and Testing data was collected from [ApneaECG](https://www.physionet.org/content/apnea-ecg/1.0.0/) dataset found at [Physionet ATM](https://archive.physionet.org/cgi-bin/atm/ATM)
